SEC2.x Security Core Device Driver - Release Notes
version 1.3 August 11, 2005 sec
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:

Release 1.3 contains new functionality for SEC2.1 as implemented on the
MPC8548E. The following changes are pertinent for this release:

* This is the first release of this driver built to operate with Linux 2.6.
  All previous versions to this date have been 2.4-compatible only

* ICV-checking for MDHA and for MDHA-dependent single-pass descriptor
  types has been added. This new feature of SEC2.1 allows the caller to
  pass in a pointer to an expected signature for a given message.
  If that signature does not match the one computed for this message,
  then an error is generated.

* Kasumi (KFHA) stream cipher support has been added to this release,
  which includes processing capability for f8 stream cipher and f9
  integrity operations commonly used in 3GPP applications, along with
  their EDGE A5/3 and GSM A5/3 message format processing mode
  counterparts.

* SHA224 hash operations have been added alongside the previously existing
  SHA1 (SHA160), SHA256, and MD5.

* TLS block and stream message processing requests have been added to this
  release.

* CCMP/SRTP message support exists in this release

* RAID/XOR request types have been added to this release.

* Added improved debug output information for:
  - buffer viewability
  - scattered buffer list viewability
  - SEC descriptor buffer viewability

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limitations:

* This release has been tested on version 2.6.11 of the linux kernel for 
  PowerPC. No other kernel versions have been verified at this time.
  
* Driver has been built with GCC 3.3.3. No other compilers were used.
  
* Driver has been verified on MPC8548E silicon on a CDS. No other
  processors have been verified at this time.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Issues:

* Scripts for creating device inodes must be performed manually at this
  time. As delivered, the driver requests a dynamic major number upon
  module initialization. It is up to the operator to manually create a
  new char device inode typically named /dev/sec2, with the dynamically
  assigned major number. The minor number should remain zero.

* Driver is not instance-safe.

* Regression testing on 2.4 linux kernels, and on VxWorks 5.5.x has not
  been attempted at this time.

Release history:

* 1.2   (27 January 2005) - incorporated feedback from acceptance testing
* 1.1.1 (16 December 2004) - removed some unnecessary diagnostics
* 1.1.0 (05 December 2004) -  First LinuxPPC release
* 1.0   (June 2004) - First issue of driver after adaptation from SEC1.0.
                      VxWorks-only release, tested on MPC8555E only
