config IPV6
	tristate "The IPv6 protocol"
	default m
	select CRYPTO if IPV6_PRIVACY
	select CRYPTO_MD5 if IPV6_PRIVACY
	---help---
	  This is complemental support for the IP version 6.
	  You will still be able to do traditional IPv4 networking as well.

	  For general information about IPv6, see
	  <http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/ipng-main.html>.
	  For Linux IPv6 development information, see <http://www.linux-ipv6.org>.
	  For specific information about IPv6 under Linux, read the HOWTO at
	  <http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/>.

	  To compile this protocol support as a module, choose M here: the 
	  module will be called ipv6.

config IPV6_PRIVACY
	bool "IPv6: Privacy Extensions support"
	depends on IPV6
	---help---
	  Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6
	  support.  With this option, additional periodically-alter 
	  pseudo-random global-scope unicast address(es) will assigned to
	  your interface(s).
	
	  By default, kernel do not generate temporary addresses.
	  To use temporary addresses, do
	
	        echo 2 >/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/use_tempaddr 

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt> for details.

config IPV6_PRIVACY_MD5
	bool "IPv6: Use RFC 3041 randomized interface identifiers"
	depends on IPV6_PRIVACY
	---help---
	  Instead of standard pseudo random generator, use
	  traditional algorithm described in the original RFC 3041.

config IPV6_ROUTER_PREF
	bool "IPv6: default router preference"
	depends on IPV6

config IPV6_NEW_ROUNDROBIN
	bool
	depends on IPV6_ROUTER_PREF
	default y

config INET6_AH
	tristate "IPv6: AH transformation"
	depends on IPV6
	select XFRM
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_HMAC
	select CRYPTO_MD5
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	---help---
	  Support for IPsec AH.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config INET6_ESP
	tristate "IPv6: ESP transformation"
	depends on IPV6
	select XFRM
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_HMAC
	select CRYPTO_MD5
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	select CRYPTO_DES
	---help---
	  Support for IPsec ESP.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config INET6_IPCOMP
	tristate "IPv6: IPComp transformation"
	depends on IPV6
	select XFRM
	select INET6_TUNNEL
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_DEFLATE
	---help---
	  Support for IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) (RFC3173),
	  typically needed for IPsec.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config INET6_TUNNEL
	tristate "IPv6: tunnel transformation"
	depends on IPV6
	select XFRM
	---help---
	  Support for generic IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel transformation, which is
	  required by the IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling module as well as tunnel mode
	  IPComp.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config IPV6_TUNNEL
	tristate "IPv6: IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel"
	depends on IPV6
	---help---
	  Support for IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels described in RFC 2473.

	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_ADVANCED_ROUTER
	bool "IPv6: advanced router (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on IPV6 && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  If you intend to run your Linux box mostly as an IPv6 router
	  or otherwise need more advanced routing features, say Y; you
	  will then be presented with several options that allow more
	  precise control about the routing process.

	  The answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel:
	  answering N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about advanced routing.

	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES
	bool "IPv6: policy routing"
	depends on IPV6_ADVANCED_ROUTER
	---help---
	  Normally, a router decides what to do with a received packet based
	  solely on the packet's final destination address.  If you say Y here,
	  the Linux router will also be able to take the packet's source
	  address and incoming interface into account.

	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_SUBTREES
	bool "IPv6: source address based routing"
	depends on IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES
	---help---
	  Enable policy routing by source address or prefix.  To set up source
	  address based routing you need to define source prefix specific
	  policy rules using iproute2 or a similar tool.

	  As the first matching policy rule is always applied, policy rules
	  should be ordered by decreasing source and destination prefix length,
	  with the exception of the preconfigured special local rule.

	  The destination address is still the primary routing key, so mixing
	  normal and source prefix specific routes in the same routing table
	  may sometimes lead to unintended routing behavior.  This can be
	  avoided by defining different routing tables for the normal and
	  source prefix specific routes.

	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_MIP6
	bool "IPv6: Mobility (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on IPV6 && EXPERIMENTAL
	select XFRM
	select XFRM_USER
	select XFRM_ENHANCEMENT
	---help---
	  Support for IPv6 Mobility.

	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_MIP6_DEBUG
	bool "IPv6: Moblity Debug Message"
	depends on IPV6_MIP6
	---help---
	  Be sure to say Y and record debug messages when submitting a
	  bug report.
	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_MROUTE
	bool "IPv6: multicast routing (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on IPV6 && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Experimental support for IPv6 multicast forwarding.
	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_PIMSM_V2
	bool "IPv6: PIM-SM version 2 support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on IPV6_MROUTE
	---help---
	  Support for IPv6 PIM multicast routing protocol PIM-SMv2.
	  If unsure, say N.

config IPV6_STATISTICS
	bool "IPv6: per-interface statistics for SNMP"
	depends on IPV6 && EXPERIMENTAL

config IPV6_STATISTICS_DEBUG
	bool "IPv6: debug per-interface statistics for SNMP"
	depends on IPV6_STATISTICS
	---help---
	  Say N.
